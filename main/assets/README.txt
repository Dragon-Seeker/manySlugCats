NON-STEAM INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
Drag the entire mod folder (the one containing modinfo.json) into this location:
\Rain World\RainWorld_Data\StreamingAssets\mods

The mod should then show up under the "Remix" menu for you to enable.

Once enabled, you can click on the mod title to edit configuration settings.
If you can see the mod config screen, you're all good to go!

Works with Steam Remote play and Parsec, but Parsec is much more stable with large groups.

RECOMMENDED MODS FOR LARGE GROUPS:
-Stick Together
-SBCameraScroll

IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES:
If using Parsec, Parsec caps controller connections at 10, excluding any controllers used by the host. 
Any additional players must either use keyboard or add controllers through a different remote session, like Steam Remote Play.
