  "Description": "Play Rain World with up to 16 players! This mod extends the maximum player count for Jolly Co-Op, Expeditions, and Arena Mode.\r\n\r\nWorks with Steam Remote play and Parsec, but Parsec is much more stable with large groups.\r\n\r\n[u][b]RECOMMENDED MODS FOR LARGE GROUPS:[/b][/u]\r\n-[u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026749851]Stick Together[/url][/u]\r\n-[u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928752589\u0026searchtext=SBCamera]SBCameraScroll[/url][/u]\r\n\r\n[u][b]IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES[/b][/u]\r\nIf using Parsec, Parsec caps controller connections at 10, excluding any controllers used by the host. Any additional players must either use keyboard or add controllers through a different remote session, like Steam Remote Play.\r\n[hr]\r\n[u][url=https://discord.gg/cj4tvcjcQ8]Myriad Discord server[/url][/u]\r\n[u][url=https://github.com/Dragon-Seeker/myriad]Github[/url][/u]\r\n\r\nThis is the opening week beta so please report any bugs or mod incompatibilities that you find!",
